Write a function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount of money, given an array of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2:

```1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.```
Also, assume that you have an infinite amount of coins.

Your function should take an amount to change and an array of unique denominations for the coins

### **[4 kyu]** [Catching Car Mileage Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52c4dd683bfd3b434c000292)
Let's make it so Bob never misses another interesting number. We've hacked into his car's computer, and we have a box hooked up that reads mileage numbers. We've got a box glued to his dash that lights up yellow or green depending on whether it receives a 1 or a 2 (respectively).

It's up to you, intrepid warrior, to glue the parts together. Write the function that parses the mileage number input, and returns a 2 if the number is "interesting" (see below), a 1 if an interesting number occurs within the next two miles, or a 0 if the number is not interesting.

### **[5 kyu]** [Count IP Addresses](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526989a41034285187000de4)
Implement a function that receives two IPv4 addresses, and returns the number of addresses between them (including the first one, excluding the last one).

All inputs will be valid IPv4 addresses in the form of strings. The last address will always be greater than the first one. Given a number, say prod (for product), we search two Fibonacci numbers F(n) and F(n+1) verifying: F(n) * F(n+1) = prod. Your function productFib takes an integer (prod) and returns an array:

```[F(n), F(n+1), true] or {F(n), F(n+1), 1} or (F(n), F(n+1), True)``` depending on the language if F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.
If you don't find two consecutive F(m) verifying F(m) * F(m+1) = prodyou will return:

```[F(m), F(m+1), false] or {F(n), F(n+1), 0} or (F(n), F(n+1), False)]```

### **[6 kyu]** [Tribonacci Sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/556deca17c58da83c00002db) 
Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

### **[6 kyu]** [Vasya - Clerk](https://www.codewars.com/kata/555615a77ebc7c2c8a0000b8) 
The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

### **[6 kyu]** [Array.diff](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009)
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

```array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]```

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

```array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]```

### **[6 kyu]** [Bouncing Balls](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5544c7a5cb454edb3c000047) 
A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?
