## Problems
### **[6 kyu]** [Stop gninnipS My sdroW!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5264d2b162488dc400000001)
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

### **[6 kyu]** [Array.diff](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009)
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

```array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]```

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

```array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]```

### **[6 kyu]** [Simple Sentences](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5297bf69649be865e6000922/)
Implement a function, so it will produce a sentence out of the given parts.
Array of parts could contain:
- words
- commas in the middle;
- multiple periods at the end.
Sentence making rules:
- there must always be a space between words;
- there must not be a space between a comma and word on the left;
- there must always be one and only one period at the end of a sentence.

### **[6 kyu]** [Your order, please](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c45be3b2079eccff00010f)
Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

### **[7 kyu]** [Descending Order](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5467e4d82edf8bbf40000155)
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
